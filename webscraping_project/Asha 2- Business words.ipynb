The topics selection can be based on the skills required for data analyst/scientist job postings from websites like http://www.indeed.ca (may need to do web-scraping), and Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey http://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017/ on curriculums of courses offered on online platforms, such as http://CognitiveClass.ai, Coursera, EdX, DataCamp, and/or any other data that your team can find or collect yourself. \n",

We tried using the stop words from nltk to filter out the noise however it does not have enough stop words for our purposes. We also tried using the stop words provided in assignment 1 but the number of stops words was not adequate. Hence, instead of using stop words to filter out the noise, we decided to make a bag of technical words in order to extract the key skills from job postings. To make the bag of technical words, we scrape a website from India called \"www.naukri.com/\". _Naurki_ has a separate category for each job posting highlighting the  key skills needed (see example below).
